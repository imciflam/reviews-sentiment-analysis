ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .', 'and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" .', 'the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .', 'the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .', 'in his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .', \"although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .\", \"murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .\", \"through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .\", \"but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .\", \"braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .\", 'however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .', 'the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .', 'while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .', \"this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .\", 'compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .', 'braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .', 'what makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist .', 'mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .', 'wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .', 'naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .', \"however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .\", \"because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .\", 'mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .', 'most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .', \"brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .\", \"david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .\", 'women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .', \"catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .\", 'from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .', 'photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .', 'on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .', 'although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .', 'the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .', 'he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood .', \"to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .\", 'however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .', 'according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .', 'this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .', 'in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently

            "various films seen at the seattle film festival :it's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson wellesa recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle's planned \" docu-drama \" of amazing stories around the world named it's all true , this short dealt with welle's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft .while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set .impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians .sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play \" rain \" , based on w . somerset maugham's story \" miss thompson \" cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silentafter the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago .this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" .this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script .the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel .swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie .unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script .the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we've been waiting an hour and a half for .still , it's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds .a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it .the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil pizathis is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids .it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it .perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly doesn't show capitalism in a good light .nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter .as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over .not that it wasn't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done .all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats .boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , doesn't it ?add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .some gore .don't bring children to this one .don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped .blech .. no fun whatsoever .meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titledthis film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money .his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans .meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany .after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany .of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there .the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .c -- $2 . 50 .the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclementsafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :1 ) be wary of french comedies .these people like jerry lewis .2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching .4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out !australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task .well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards .it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .lots and lots of horses .the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) .the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway .actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life .grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks .\n",
            "it seems like i'm reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now .scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the \" relentless \" department .i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it's citizen hook .jennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . wakingup .she lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals .paranoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station's 4th of july getaway giveaway .bikini-ready julie invites boyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who-and here's the movie's biggest mystery-turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off .until he gets a roadside visit from captain hell-liner himself , that is .unaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla's boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who's sweet on julie .to make a long story short-i can't believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster .not only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn't working properly !( you think killing is hard ?try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor's \" i will survive \" now contains the lyric \" i still know what you did last summer ! \" )all is not lost-ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co .this picture is really about breasts : two of them .julie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan .based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i can't imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me-he gets jennifer love-hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp !lucky bastard .i didn't like i know what you did last summer and i can't say i liked this continuation any more or less .the pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ?i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis's random selection of victims .( i don't think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer . )director cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here's my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won't rely on so many shock notes .and let that person run wild with the camera .( aside : if blandy [sic] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says \" baby \" to a minimum .thanks in advance . )\n",
            "\" soldier \" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting .the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision .brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little .then it goes nowhere with that idea .there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen .the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better .i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting .between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited .his performance in that way isn't all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film .other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters .but enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ?isn't the most important part of an action film , well , the action ?even in this aspect the film is a disappointment .in mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining .however , he fails to repeat that in this film .the combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve .fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize .but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s .if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film .however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment .\n",
